# Interactive Population Map
Project Overview
This project is an interactive population map, designed to allow users to visualize population trends and growth rates across different counties in Austin Texas. The map provides data from 2020 up to 2025, with an interactive slider to browse through each year.

## Features of this project include:

Leaflet.js integration: The interactive map is powered by Leaflet.js, a leading open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. This integration provides a smooth and responsive user interface that's compatible with both desktop and mobile devices.

Dynamic population table: Alongside the map, the application includes a dynamic population table that updates as the user changes the selected year. This table provides detailed county-specific information, including the total population, percentage growth, and number of building permits issued.

Year slider: Users can adjust the displayed year with a slider, allowing for dynamic visualization of population changes over time. This feature, coupled with the dynamic population table, allows for a comprehensive overview of population trends.

Getting Started
To get the project running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Open the index.html file in your browser.
Note: As the project uses ES6 modules, you might need to set up a local server to avoid CORS issues. If you have Python installed, this can be done by running python -m SimpleHTTPServer (Python 2) or python -m http.server (Python 3) in your terminal from the project directory.

Future Development
There are several potential avenues for future development to enhance the application's functionality, including:

Integration with a back-end server for real-time population data.
Inclusion of more detailed demographic data.
The implementation of predictive analytics for future population trends.
